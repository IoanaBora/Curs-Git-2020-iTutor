Ingredients
3 rashers of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon
4 higher-welfare chipolatas
olive oil
160 g ripe tomatoes
4 large free-range eggs
3 slices of bread

Method

Put a large non-stick (about 26cm) frying pan on a medium heat.
Lay in the bacon and sausages and add ½ a tablespoon of olive oil. Fry for 10 to 12 minutes, until the bacon is beautifully golden and the sausages are cooked through, turning occasionally.
When they’re done, use tongs to move the bacon and sausages out of the pan, leaving the fat behind.
Reduce the heat to low, then halve or quarter the tomatoes, depending on their size, adding them to the pan as you go. Fry for a couple of minutes.
Crack the eggs into the pan, using the tongs to move the tomatoes randomly on top of them as you go.
As the eggs are frying, slice up your bacon and sausages, and return them to the pan, spacing them about so everyone will get a nice portion.
Season with black pepper, then cover with a lid until the eggs are cooked to your liking. Toast the bread.
Use a fish slice or spatula to loosen the eggs around the edges, then slide the whole thing onto a board or platter, like a frisbee, ready to serve in the middle of the table. Line up your hot toast, get your condiments out, and tuck in.
